## Tower of Power
  The idea of this game is that you have a fixed bar and a moving bar and you have to connect each other. How do you do that ? By pushing the button exactly in the moment when they are at the same level. Imagine that you have two cables and you have to connect them to produce electricity. Seems easy, right?
  
  Initially you have three lives and every time you match the bars the score will increase by one. When you miss, you lose a life. The fixed bar is positioned randomly.
  As you progress, after certain period of time the level and the speed will increase and it will get pretty hard to play. After you lose, you'll be able to see if you managed to get a highscore. In case of that, your name and highscore will be saved for all to see them. 
  In the game menu, which you scroll through with the joystick, you are able to enter your name, to see the last saved highscore, to see some info about the game(such as the name of the creator and his Github link, the game name etc.) and of course, you press Play to start the game. After finishing the game, you can see your score and press Play again to restart the game.
