## analogRGBControl 
  The scope of this homework is to use three potentiometers in order to directly control the colors of an RGB LED. For this I wired the potentiometers to analog input pins A0, A1 and A2, and RGB LED to analog output pins 9, 10 and 11. Then I needed to map the read values from input because these are between 0..1023 and the written values are between 0..255.
